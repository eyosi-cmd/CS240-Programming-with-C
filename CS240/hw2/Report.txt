1. Hours to complete the project: 7 hours

2. Write a Report.txt that discusses what you found difficult about this assignment, how you planned
 your approach to it, and what you learned completing it.

    At first, I did find a difficult time making sense the logic behind this problem. 
So, I wrote a Sudo-code to understand how letters counting works, and word countings work.
Also, I kept getting zeros for the word countings because I did not know what alphanumeric means 
until I search on google what are alphanumeric characters. Formatting the width of the output 
and determining the length for asterisks is also another problem that challenged me, 
but after looking at the notes and the book I understand how formatting works in programming c.
In general, the digit exercise that we did in a class was a base that I used to do this homework.



3. All the source that used to compelete this homework

    Google search: what is Alphanumeric? (tutorial point programming c)
    Book: The C Programming Language by Brian W. Kernighan, 
           about how 'printf' works in terms of an output formation,
           int to float conversion, and implementing additional methods.
    Note: from the class note, I used the main method structure of a c code.
