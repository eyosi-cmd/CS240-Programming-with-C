a) write first 10 numbers
0, 1, 2 (base 3)

Ternary: 0,1,2,10,11,12, 20,21, 22, 100
(This are the first 10 numbers in ternary)

b) define complement
 (b-1)'s complement when the base 3
 For example: '10' (base 3 ):
 2's complement for '10' is '221' or -2 (signed) and 25 (unsigned)
 3's complement for '10' in ternary is '222' or -1 (signed) and 26 (unsigned)
c) Digit wise Oprations
yes, digit wise might work in ternary number system but computers will work only in binary it's always requred binary converstion specially in performing c programing langues, (but there will be a perblem on performing XOR in ternary since (base 3 number) will be created with 3 digits, one digit will be an outlayer). Like a XOR b = b XOR a, but it will not work with a, b, c.
