1. Hours to complete the project: 10 hours

2. Write a Report.txt that discusses what you found difficult about this assignment, how you planned
 your approach to it, and what you learned completing it.

    The instructions for this project was straight forward which the steps to solve the problem have already given clearly on the pdf file. 
The first challenge was to know the right calculation to convert an integer to quaternary and vigesimal number system.
Even though, hints was given in "itox.h" file and the pdf file, I still have to know how to apply the ASCII numerical expressions for each character 
in the two given number systems. Also, storing the quaternary and vigesimal strings in the array with correct position and values was challenging
because I was getting output in reverse order at first compared to the right output of the problem. So, I used a for loop to store the values 
from the end of the array to the beginning that let me get the right output and size. The other challege was on how to re-covert the corginal decimal input
without using pow() fuction to find multiplier of 4 and 20 in problem, so I created another array called power to store each power values of 4 and 20, and
I used the class note about decimal to hexadecimal converstion to deal this portion of the problem. Overall, following the insturtions in the pdf files do
most parts of the problem. 



3. All the source that used to compelete this homework

    Google search: how to convert hex to decimal and decimal to hex
    Book: The C Programming Language by Brian W. Kernighan, 
           about number systems
    Note: From the class notes, I read about number conversion calcualtions
         so I could apply in my code.
